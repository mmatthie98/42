Bornto Be Root is the first project in which we'll be using a virtual machine.

The aim of this project is to learn how to configure a server, which must have a defined firewall, ssh and high-security password. Debian was used as the operating system.

A script runs every 10 minutes to display the machine's performance and characteristics.

This project taught me patience and perseverance, which helped me a lot later on.
