This project was my first major graphics project. We had to recode the old and famous Wolfenstein 3D, and we used raycasting to implement our decor. 

A very instructive collaborative project, I had the opportunity to perfect my skills and knowledge of mlx.

Cooperation, rigor and organization were the strong points of this project, and my partner and I managed to come to an agreement so that the project could be carried out quickly and efficiently.

To lauch the project u had to go in the minilibx folder, use make and come back and make to the src.

You can after that use : ./cub3D maps/map.cub;
