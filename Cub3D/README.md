This project was my first major graphics project. We had to recode the old and famous Wolfenstein 3D, and we used raycasting to implement our decor. 

A very instructive collaborative project, I had the opportunity to perfect my skills and knowledge of mlx.

Cooperation, rigor and organization were the strong points of this project, and my partner and I managed to come to an agreement so that the project could be carried out quickly and efficiently.

To lauch the project you had to go in the minilibx folder, use make and come back and make to the src.

You can after that use : ./cub3D maps/map.cub;
