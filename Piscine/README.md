- 42 Piscine

This is the set of exercises (excluding rush: weekend team project) for the days I had the opportunity to complete during my swimming pool.

The shell days are missing, but most of the pool is here.
It was a very instructive experience, as I had to adapt and persevere, which I think are essential skills.
