- Get_Next_Line

Get_next_line is a function frequently used in C programming to read one line at a time from a file or continuous data source, such as standard input or a network socket.

This function is particularly useful when you need to process a file line by line, without having to load the entire file into memory.

I have learned to deal with many problems such as leaks, buffer overflows, memory overflows, segmentation errors, etc. And i learned the file descriptor's notion.

To run this program, you need to make and launch the gnl executable, into which you can add any file descriptor you like.
