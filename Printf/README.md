The purpose of this project is to reimplement printf with the following options: %c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X.
With this project, I had the opportunity to learn the parsing aspect of a project, taking into account the inputs and their analysis allowed me to successfully complete this project.
I also had the opportunity to learn more about the va_arg() command in the documentation.
