This project was there to familiarised me with Docker engine, in fact Docker and Docker-compose is a usefull tools for developers, you ain't need to install something instead of Docker. 

To do so, the aim of this project was to create a website with wordpress, mariadb and nginx. We do this project on a virtual machine.

Docker will automatically at start launch all pre-requesite installation for your application or website.

We had to used wordpress, mariadb and nginx. Every service needed to had it's own container, for that we used docker-compose.
