The aim of this project was to familiarize myself with the Docker engine, as Docker and Docker-compose are useful tools for developers, you don't need to install anything in place of Docker. 

The aim of this project was to create a website using wordpress, mariadb and nginx. We're running this project on a virtual machine.

Docker will automatically launch all pre-requisite installations for your application or website at startup.

Each service needed its own container, so we used docker-compose. Docker-compose lets you launch all the containers in the network you've set up, manage dependencies and also handle launch errors or crashes. In this case, Docker will try to restart the container that crashed, depending on the option added.
